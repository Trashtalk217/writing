# On the topic of Originality

Despite it's apparent usefulness, 'originality' remains one of the nichest subjects studied at the Idaho State University for Exceptional Things.
It is, after all, a very hard thing to study.
Take for example a revolutionary new idea in the study of boats.
Originality may be found within this idea, but it's not inherently original.
This revolutionary new idea may have been build on, horror of horrors, other research, so you can't, as a self-respected originality researcher, call it a truly original and / or novel idea.
And if these researchers, originalogists, had to study boat technology, they'd seize to be originality researchers and become boatologists, which would bring great shame to the profession.
No, that simply could not fly, the founding founders of the originality field have therefor decided that originality could only be studied in isolation, lest the scope of the field got out of hand.
The idea behind this doctrine was to study originality in it's purest form to then later recreate it and apply it to other sciences.
A truly novel goal, later critics would describe it as the 'only original idea the field has ever produced', but modern originalogists agree that this idea wasn't actually original as it was describable with words, inherently unoriginal things in their nature.
At this point you, the reader, might start to see the problem with the field, but this hasn't stopped many a researcher to stare out of a train window into the distance trying to stumble upon a truly original idea.
Many showers were had trying to capture a glimpse of true creativeness.
Some have even resorted to sleeping 18 hours a day, hoping to catch some novelty in their dreams.
Drugs, long walks and spiritual pilgrimages were also tried, yet is was all for naught.
While many have claimed that they've found the platonic ideal, they were all convincingly proven wrong by their peers.
Yet, the field still exists to this day, although at a small size.
There are still originalogists looking for their holy grail.
Something that'll likely speak to the strength and perseverance of mankind, for the romantically inclined.
For the more cynically sided, this might look a lot more like a fools errant.
Whatever you may think, they keep looking, searching for True Originality.
