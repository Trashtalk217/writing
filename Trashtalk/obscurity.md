# Obscure in Excentricity

People from outside Idaho usually haven't heard of the Idaho State University for Exceptional things.
There are a couple of obvious reasons for this.
The university is, in fact, located in Idaho, not the most populous state.
It's no Ivy League and it's quite small, only facilitating around 5000 students any given year.

If you, like 90% of the readers of this online newspaper, live in Idaho, this is no new information.
But the last reason is less obvious and there's an excellent story behind it.

It started in the 1950s.
Anna Goldwing had been working in Hollywood as a popular actress for over a decade.
She was also an active member of the Communist Party of the United States of America, which was a problem at the time.
Her refusal to part with the CPUSA made her 1 of the 42 women on the Hollywood blacklist, making it almost impossible for her to find work.
This, combined with the constant threat of prosecution by the HUAC (House Un-American Activities Committee), motivated her to move away from Hollywood and settle here in Idaho.
Now this story of tremendous political intrigue comes to a scratching halt as she settled in Nampa, finding work as a high school teacher.

In Nampa, she'd often meet with the then Chancellor of the ISUET, Robert Paul, a man with two first names. 
The term 'Chancellor' has quite a bit of history, which we'll skip here. 
The important thing to know is that Robert Paul was merely the ceremonial head of the university.

Through the conversations with Robert, she learned about the university in Magic Valley and the fact that Robert was going to resign as Chancellor.

Anna would later state that she had plans to return to politics in at least some form: intending to run for local government in Nampa.
But with this opportunity, she shifted focus: 
"Education is a beautiful thing. A politician only has one body and one lifetime with which to create change.  A teacher, through his or her students, has plenty more."

She eventually was elected by the university board as the next Chancellor. 
Not because the board particularly liked her, but because she was hugely popular with the students, thanks to her former actress status.
Her first act as the ceremonial head of the ISUET was to make her position less ceremonial.

This article only aspires to be a summary so we won't go into university politics here. 
Just assume it's regular politics with slightly more titles in front of names.

After her first five years, she had consolidated power and practically ruled the institution. 
Some called this a communist takeover, and that's basically what it was. 
Although the definition of communism would be doing a lot of heavy lifting in that sentence. 
There's a difference between the communism of the CPUSA around the early 60s and the communism of Stalinist Russia.

During the 60s, the height of her reign, she enacted some of the most sweeping changes. 
There are too many to list here and quite a few are plenty controversial.
But this is about a quiet change, a change that is still in the protocol to this day.

The university's advertising money is almost nonexistent. 
The reasoning for this policy was that public schools should focus more on education than on marketing. 
And that enrolled students shouldn't pay for the onboarding costs of future students, but their education. 

That's the last reason why so few have heard of the ISUET, with the story behind it.

Anna Goldwing resigned in 69' over a scandal involving the misappropriation of state funds. 
A lot of her policies were reversed almost immediately after she left.

But some of her changes, like the advertising rule, are still here today.
And even if Anna Goldwing is scarcely remembered for her acting career today, she still casts an impressive shadow over the ISUET.

Perhaps she did get more than a single lifetime.
