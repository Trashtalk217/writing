# The Book of All Advice

It's almost the end of the year and that means it's time for another 'Book of All Advice'-update at the ISUET.  

The Book of All Advice is a living document maintained by the university book club, which contains all the possible advice a person could need or give. 
It has classics such as 'Be Yourself,' 'Treat Others Like You Wish To Be Treated,' and 'If Your Friends Jump Off A Bridge, Would You?'

But there are also some, perhaps, lesser-known words of wisdom, such as: 'All Dichotomies Are False Dichotomies,' 'There Is No Such Thing As A Fish' and 'Words Are Made Up, So Is Love.'  

These phrases, along with about two thousand others, make up the core of the book. 
One can however modify a lot of advice with meta-advice, which is listed in the first section of the book. 
For example: Applying the meta-advice 'Never Deal In Absolutes' to 'Do No Harm' would result in 'Mostly Do No Harm.' 
It's not as catchy, but it's still good advice.  

Including the meta-advice and the variations resulting from their application, there are about 20.000 pieces of advice in the book. Truly a staggering number, but before you start breaking into the university to steal such a great source of knowledge, there are a couple of things you need to know first.  

Firstly, not all of the advice is very good. Some of it is actively counterproductive or even harmful. There is - for example - a bit of meta-advice that goes: 'Consider The Opposite.' Applying this to the previously mentioned 'Do No Harm' gives less than stellar results. It's not the Book of All Good Advice, just *all* advice.  

Secondly, all advice is provided as-is and without any context. So picking the advice that applies best is left as an exercise to the reader.  

Thirdly, the book and all of its versions since 2008 are available online at [bookofalladvice.edu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) for free. 
It's also in the public domain and it has been used a lot as a reference for self-help books.  

Anyhow, this book is updated yearly. 
This December, the members of the book club will once more retrieve the original leather binder from an Actual Airtight Safe. 
They open the book up, remove outdated pages, and insert new ones. 
The old pages are then framed and sold at auction.
The proceeds go to charity.
This year, the club picked out five local food banks.  

Because 'Advice Is Useless If You Ignore It' and 'Do Good.'
