[Investigator carefully closes the door, and takes a seat opposite to Samuel]

Investigator: Good afternoon Samuel, how's it going?
Samuel Holden: [mumbles inaudibly]
I: I've been talking to your mom and dad, Samuel, or should I call you Sam?
S: Sam's for friends, just Samuel, man.
I: Alright, Samuel, so I've been talking to your old folks.
S: [mumbles]
I: I'll bet you're aware that they're not too happy to find their son under investigation.
S: Are you expecting a response?
I: This is serious Samuel, don't act like it's not. Anyway, have you had your rights read before?
S: Can't say I have.
I: But you know what I'm talking about.
S: Sure, I've seen movies.
I: Well, I'm still going to go through this, just to make sure. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in court of law. Right to talk to a lawyer prior to questioning or making any statements. Have them present with you while being questioned. Canâ€™t afford to hire a lawyer, one will be appointed by the court to represent you before any questions if you desire one. You may stop the questioning or making statements at any time by refusing to answer further or requesting to consult with an attorney prior to continuing questioning or making statements. Those are your rights. The second part of this is to let us now that you understand your rights and that you are willing to answer some questions. You're basically agreeing that "I don't need a lawyer at this time, I know what I'm doing." Do you understand?
S: I guess.
I: Alright then. So do you have any idea why you're here?
S: I can't possibly imagine why, man.
I: Have you recently been to the bridge at the end of Moore Ave? It's near the old Flee Market.
S: Yeah, I've been there.
I: Hanging out?
S: [nods]
I: When were you last there?
S: Like, yesterday, no wait, the day before yesterday: Monday.
I: Why were you there?
S: Just hanging out with the crew. Danny brought the stuff I remember.
I: And by 'the stuff' you mean?
S: Beer, what else?
I: Nevermind, Who else was there, I imagine that it wasn't just you two.
S: Yeah, Sarah was there too. Eli, Dirk, Ed too. Almost the whole gang showed up.
I: Just to clarify, you are referring to Daniel Bernal, Sarah Peeley, Eliza Hudson, Dirk Creek and Eduardo Bernal?
S: Those are their full names, yeah.
I: Thank you. I have it here that y'all were hanging around between 10 and 3. Can you confirm?
S: No...
I: What do you mean, no?
S: We started around 10, that much I remember, but I can't recollect past midnight.
I: I suppose the booze was the problem then.
S: Nononononononono, it was the radiation.
I: Radiation?
S: Yes, the moon radiation. It makes me forgetfull sometimes. [snickers]
I: Are you pulling my leg, young man?
S: Do I look like a young man, old man? Anyway, those moonbeams are great. If your looking for a good time, those'll get you there.
I: Alrighty... What do you remember of that evening.
S: Not much, was a lot of fun. Danny knows how to celebrate a birthday.
I: That's my fault, shoulda been more specific. What did you talk about with them.
S: I don't remember the specifics. I remember one convo we had about... I don't know if I can say that on tape.
I: Was it about the bankheist?
S: Maybe?
I: I've spoken to Sarah earlier, she said that you lot were jokingly talking about robbing a bank.
S: Oh...
I: Don't worry about it Sam, we know that those things are just jokes, and you lot would never follow through with them.
S: But why am I here then. It seems like nothing illegal has transpired?
I: 'Transpired?'
S: Transpired.
I: Well here's the thing we've been trying to figure out. That bridge you guys where hanging out at. I don't know how to make this sound not ridiculous. Well, -I'm just going to say it- it's gone. And it seems like you were the last people to be around it.
S: Just gone?
I: Yes, and we would like to know what happened to it. I mean, it wasn't the golden gate bridge, but it was twenty feet long and wide enough for cars. So we're kinda concerned, you get me?
S: I guess so. That's strange.
I: And here's the kicker. We've talked to a lot of your friends, and while quite a few were too drunk at the time. A few of your friends told me that you 'ate' the bridge.
S: I don't believe you. Who told you that I 'ate' a bridge.
I: Well, We've interviewed all of your friends, and while Eduardo, Dirk and Eliza didn't recall anything specific. Daniel mentioned something along the lines of "Sam claimed he could eat a bridge." And Sarah said that she actually saw you do it. And I've come to understand that Sarah doesn't drink.
S: No, she doesn't. When it comes to these sorts of things I often trust her more than myself, but this is just too weird.
I: What about Daniel?
S: He's reliable enough, but he wasn't sober at that party, that much I can remember.
I: Let's just let this rest for a moment. What did you do yesterday?
S: Very, very little. I slep in til nine in the evening.
I: The evening?
S: Yeah [inaudible mumbling]
I: And how was the rest of the day?
S: Got out, greeted my parents, ate late dinner and went back to bed.
I: And then?
S: I slept till eight and was just about done with breakfast when the cops showed up. You guys, I mean.
I: Alright, I think that's about most of it.
S: Really?
I: If there's anything else you'd like to mention, be my guest, but I think we're done here.
S: I... alright. Can I go?
I: We're going to have to fill in some paperwork together, but after that you can go. Let me just turn off the recording.
