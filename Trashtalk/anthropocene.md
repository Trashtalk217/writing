# Introduction to the Anthropocene

'Introduction to the Anthropocene' is one of the courses that has seen the largest spike in enrollment over the last few years. 
It's an optional course usually followed by geography, anthropology, and earth and environment students. 
But it has recently gotten the attention of students from other areas, mostly social studies.  

At this point in the article, definitions become relevant. 
The Anthropocene is a geological period in which humans have had a significant impact on the earth's geography and ecosystems. 
It started around 10.000* years ago and continues to this day. 
As of writing, very considerable people and their organizations don't officially recognize the term 'Anthropocene' as a descriptor of a geological era. 
But it has seen widespread use in pop culture nonetheless.  

An avid proponent of this word, professor John Johnson, started giving 'Introduction to the Anthropocene' in 1990. 
The course examines the multiple ways humans have changed and shaped the environment they inhabit. 
The course covers, among other things, Aboriginal fire-stick farming, Dutch land reclamation, and, of course, man-made climate change.  

John Johnson has since retired and his daughter, Amy Johnson, is the current lecturer for the course. 
Two years ago, she was surprised to see a sharp dropoff in attendance after the first few lectures. 
She decided to investigate and discovered that the course didn't meet expectations for many students.  

"It turns out there's this podcast, the Anthropocene Reviewed. 
In which some writer reviews different parts of the human experience on a five-star scale. 
This podcast shaped their expectations for the course," she recently reported to this paper.  

The podcast has reviewed things such as the capacity for wonder, the board game monopoly, and sports rivalries.  

"It was clear that these students weren't interested in what the course offered, but from speaking with them, I've gathered that they were still highly motivated. 
This motivation, combined with the sheer number of students dropping out early, was enough reason to look into alternatives for them," Amy continued.  

It isn't officially confirmed yet, but a new course - 'Introduction to the Cultural Anthropocene' - will most likely be added to the curriculum next year. 
Professor Amy Johson explains:  

"At the ISUET, we pride ourselves on the breadth of study opportunities we provide our students. 
We teach things like Theoretical Physics for Stunt Performances, Game Theory for Prisoners, and the History of Magic. 
There's no reason why we shouldn't teach our students about the Cultural Anthropocene. 
It's fascinating and deserves our attention."  

She declined to go deeper into the specificities of the course, stating that the proposed subject doesn't fall in her field of expertise. 
One of her trusted colleagues is still filling in the details for the new elective.  

John Green, the creator of the Anthropocene Reviewed, hasn't yet responded to our emails. 
We'll make sure to send more and report his reaction.
