# A Thinking Man's Game

Modern sports are created in high schools, colleges, and universities.

Basketball was famously created at a YMCA in 1891.
More recent examples include Ultimate Frisbee (Ultimate), which was developed at Columbia High School in New Jersey in 1968. 
The Idaho State University for Exceptional Things goes one step further with the New Sports Research Centre, professionalizing the process of creating sports.
Here, new sports are actively being developed in an interdisciplinary effort between mechanical biologists, sports psychologists, and even game theorists.
You've probably heard of some of the sports created there.
Fastball, Assisted Long Jump and Warpush are some of the success stories.

Yet, the sport we're concerned with today is not strictly a physical one, and it also wasn't created in the Centre.
'Contradictions' is a game invented by Brian Halifax and David Gilbert, two former students and roommates at the ISUET.

The game resembles an argument. 
Two players take turns asking each other binary questions, which the other has to answer.
A binary question could be a yes-or-no question, or an or-question, where the opponent needs to pick between two options.
The point of the game is to expose a contradictory belief of the opponent.
The first two questions are, by tradition, always the same:

A: "Do you have any contradictory beliefs?"  
B: "No, do you have any contradictory beliefs?"  
A: "No..."  

After which player A can ask the first real question and the game can truly begin.
 
When Brian and David first introduced the game, they claimed that it was inspired by GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems.
A famous set of theorems that lay bare the limitations of axiomatic systems used by mathematics.
They later corrected this statement, however.
The idea was birthed instead by the endless arguments over politics they had while they lived together.
They only learned about the incompleteness theorems the night before they presented the game to a social philosophy class.
The game has been a staple at the ISUET's philosophy bachelor ever since.

The growth of the game into a sport was slow yet steady.
The first major change that made the game more competitive was the explicit admission of lying.
This allows players to experiment with different morals and beliefs to try and throw their opponents for a loop.
This change also had unintended side-effects, but we'll get to that.

The second big change was the introduction of a timer, very similar to the timers used in Chess.
This change was excellent for viewing these matches, as they capped the length of any individual game, while simultaneously putting the players under more pressure.
The last thing the game needed to become a sport was a tournament with judges.

David and Brian achieved this in the spring of 2005 when they tricked two philosophy professors into judging a competition between ISUET undergrad students.
And the rest is history in the making.
David and Brian are still trying to push the game nationwide.
It's currently played throughout the country's universities and colleges while gaining some limited traction overseas.

It's however not all roses and sunshine, as this is the point where we get back to 'that.'
Allowing lies at games expanded the range of strategies massively, but free speech is a fickle thing.
Holocaust Deniers, Pro-Murder Advocates, and Religious Extremists played their hands at Contradictions.
And while these people were obviously (hopefully) lying.
It does not reflect well on the Contradictory Organisation, the governing body of the sport, that players espouse harmful beliefs in order to win 200 dollars.
The CO has incrementally added rules to discourage this behavior, but each step was met with vocal pushback from a subset of the player base, saying that it limited their options in play and that the game would go stale without full free speech.
Some even argued that it was unconstitutional.

This is completely false, of course, but I'm not going to end up in a political argument with someone that argues for sport.
Still, the game as it stands can be a lot of fun to play and the truthful version might even help you discover something about yourself.
The sport may yet overcome its infamy and reach for the popularity of games like Chess and Go.
But this is merely speculation and only time will tell.

Or won't it?

We can argue about it in the meantime.
