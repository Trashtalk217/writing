# Solved

*What follows is a transcript of an interview with Professor Francis Sherman at the Idaho State University for Exceptional Things. We asked him about his job, life and field of study at the university.*

**Let's start at the beginning, who even are you?**

That's a very straight forward way of starting an interview. I approve. I'm Francis Sherman, professor of Exceptional History at the ISUET. I specialize in Asian, and more specifically, Chinese alchemy, but the current courses I teach are broader in scope: Mostly undergrad courses. I'm also involved with research, of course. I'm currently waiting for a visa to visit the Yunnan province of China. The trip is going to be equal parts archeological expedition and literature study. It's all very exciting.

Work is not the only thing I do, however. I try to maintain some semblance of a life outside of my studies. I train for ballroom dancing competitions with my other half. Occasionally we go to said ballroom dancing competitions. They're a lot of fun.

**Why specifically Chinese alchemy? Wasn't alchemy more of a Western European thing?**

That's a classic misconception. Alchemy, although it does somewhat depend on your definition of alchemy, is practiced all over Eurasia and Africa. Yes, the aesthetic commonly associated with alchemy is very much Western European. Think of the purification of elements, the search for the philosopher's stone and turning lead to gold.

**I don't mean to be rude, but you just said that alchemy is practiced all over Eurasia and Africa. Is alchemy still practiced today?**

Again, that depends on your definition. Alchemy is related to things like natural medicine and while modern medicine made great strides over the last couple of centuries. Natural medicine is still widely used today. I will agree on one thing, however. The archetypal alchemy I just described is as good as dead. But, and this is the Exceptional part of this story, it's not dead for the reason you might think of.

**Alright, you got me, what happened with European alchemy?**

Someone solved it. Alicia Braucher to be more specific. She was the daughter of a Bohemian nobleman who considered himself an alchemist. In private of course, the church didn't exactly condone the practice. Anyway, she got interested in her father's studies at a young age and when she was just nineteen years old, she solved some of the major challenges that alchemy faced.

**Really? Did she turn lead into gold? Why have I never heard about this?**

Exactly. Alicia also found a method for creating a philosopher's stone. She even managed to rediscover the creation process of Damascus steel. Although those discoveries happened later, at 20 and 21 respectively.

The thing is, many alchemists of her time were more interested in the process then the result. So when Alicia published her results, under a pen name naturally. Many of the people in the field were discouraged from pursuing their research any further.

Her results weren't republished and a lot of the leading alchemists in their day went on to different endeavors. The limited first publishing - I'm liberally using the word publishing here, you wouldn't see these papers in bookshops - and the fact that she was, you know, a woman, meant that her story wasn't picked up by history. 

**But what about her discoveries. She must've gotten obscenely wealthy thanks to her discoveries.**

She was the daughter of a nobleman: she already was obscenely wealthy. And the philosopher's stone, that's a fascinating story. It turns out that the rejuvenating effect has been slightly overstated over the last couple of centuries. A daily dosage of the extract has been shown to increase life expectancy by an average of five years. That's nothing to scoff at, but because the fabrication of the stone requires quite a bit of mercury, it doesn't do much for your health unless you filter that out.

**Are her results used today?**

How do you think we are able to afford research trips to China? And considering the philosopher's stone. Its extract pairs great with a good fitness regime, even if it doesn't taste very good.

Anyway, can we now talk about Chinese alchemy? It's a very intriguing subject. I'm afraid that we've been too eurocentric up until this point.

**I'm afraid I only get so much page space for this interview, professor Sherman.**
