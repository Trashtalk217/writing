# The Basics for Leadership# 

When politicians are elected, they are exceptionally good at a select few things.
The big one is rhetoric.
Some others include: marketing, securing campaign funds, communication, and navigating the political landscape.
They might also stand for something.

In any case, in the unlikely event that a politician gets elected or appointed for a government position, they may not know enough.
That's why Danival Reynar√∞sson, an international PhD student at the Idaho State University for Exceptional Things, has collaborated with twenty other academics to create ten guidebooks.
The books are collectively called 'The Basics for Leadership,' and the series intends to provide a basic understanding of important subjects related to governance.

Danival explains: 
"Imagine a recently elected politician. 
They campaigned on a few issues, they had their answers ready during debates, and now they hold office. 
During their term, they'll deal with way more issues than you could ever possibly imagine. 
They'll need to have opinions on things they've never even considered. 
It's a tough job, so it's good to have a primer on topics they are less familiar with."

The series, which includes entries covering areas such as infrastructure, geopolitics, public health, global economics, and environmental policy, has already had a surprising number of preorders after it's initial announcement two weeks ago.
Another interesting facet of the books is their size.
They generally don't exceed 100 pages, most of them aiming lower towards 75.

Danival explained his reasoning for such a length in a recent press release: 
"We built these books around the idea that our intended audience has some, if not a lot of, resources available to them. 
We don't need to go into the possible solutions to the last mile problem regarding transportation. 
We only need to explain what the last mile problem is and why it is a problem. 
We attempt to provide enough information so that the politician reading the books can ask the right questions to the experts working for them. 
Having the books be short also greatly increases accessibility."

The focus on accessibility seemed to have certainly paid off. 
Many early reviewers have praised the books for their conciseness and very clear prose.
The New York Times described the book on global economics as follows: 
"While the book supposedly targets politicians, it makes no effort to employ political language. 
It offers a refreshing pragmatist view on governmental policy and the straightforward style makes it a delight to read even for those of us not interested in holding public office."

There's, however, a looming question hanging over the series. 
One that the New York Times was also quick to point out: "Are the books biased?"

Danivals thesis, which is largely about the way the books were created, has a lengthy chapter that attempts to answer that exact question.
He has, however, characteristically summarized his argument for the press release.

Danival acknowledges that it's likely that some bias managed to get into the final text.

"It's an inevitability," he stated, "But I otherwise think that I've done a decent enough job."

He argues that the books don't engage much with left-right politics as they merely lay out the groundwork and don't go too much into the more politicized details.
But it stays difficult, Danival explains: 
"Take for example the book on environmental policy. 
It's impossible to ignore human-caused climate change, which, while a firmly established scientific fact, is occasionally politicized."

In his conclusion, Danival makes a final statement on the misconception his books are based on: 
"We often think that politicians are elected and then simply do their job, either improving the country, region or municipality or destroying it with delusional policies. 
This is often untrue, as the job comes with many responsibilities that are difficult to manage. 
One could argue that the electorate needs to start valuing experience and vote accordingly, but that appears unlikely. 
The skills necessary for winning an election are fundamentally not the same as the skills necessary for governing. 
And as long as this stays true, there's value in "The Basics for Leadership" and other similar projects."
