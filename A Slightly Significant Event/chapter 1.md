# A Slightly Significant Event

## Chapter 1: The Magic Meerkats


There were many reasons to leave the town Aleisha grew up in, but her friends were not among them.
The club was started years ago by Aaron, who was, in his own words, 'an aficionado de la mystique.'
He had gotten a magician set for his eighth birthday and since then the whole magician persona was kind of his 'thing.'
In the beginning, this meant a lot of card tricks, to the annoyance of all involved. Later he graduated to sleight of hand tricks and impossible games. 
Games that seemed impossible to win, except if you used a very specific strategy, which of course Aaron memorized. 
He went on to do some mind-reading when he was fifteen, but more importantly: He started a club. 
The Magic Meerkats, as the club came to be known after a very serious meeting in which they decided thusly, was a club devoted to magic tricks. 
And Aleisha was invited to the first session.
She had been friends with Aaron since primary school and when they both went to the same high school they stayed close. 
Arguably not very close. 
A lot of girls in her class thought boys to be 'icky' and Aaron especially to be 'weird,' and the problem was that Aleisha liked a lot of those girls and was friends with quite a few of them. 
But Aleisha stayed close enough to get the invitation. 
So when she arrived at the first meeting of the still-unnamed magic club, she felt pretty good about herself. 
She also felt slightly nervous, as she had never really gone to this part of the school. 
Aaron was good friends with the janitors of the building and managed to get an unused space. 
This unused space was tucked away in one of the far corners of the high school, far from everything and close to very little. 
But there was no use in standing around, so Aleisha stepped forward and knocked on the door.  

"Password?" Aaron asked from the other side of the door. 
He sounded muffled, a fun reminder that the winters could get very cold and that even the doors were part of the insulation.  
"There is no password," shouted Aleisha annoyed. 
She looked around if anyone could hear her, but the school had been out for about fifteen minutes and as stated previously; this place didn't get much traffic.  
"It's open!" Aaron shouted through the door. 

Of course the door had been open. 
It was a semi-official school club, not a secret society. 
Aleisha pushed down the handle and entered a place that had never seen the light of utilization. 
The walls were bare and the floor's tiling came straight out of the seventies. 
A small window provided the room with the slightest bit of natural light, which was handy as the room didn't have any lighting installed. Just a couple of lonely wires hanging from the ceiling.
It was the size of a small office and probably only meant to house one administrative worker, maybe two if you were to really cram them in. 
But when Aleisha entered that room, it was filled with eight people including her. 
They sat around a white plastic table, you usually see outside on lawns, on folding plastic seats Aaron had probably 'borrowed' from one of the storage rooms nearby. 
One chair was still vacant and after Aleisha sat down, the first meeting of the Magic Meerkats was official.

The meetings were shrouded in mystery. 
No secretary, no bullet-points, and the members generally didn't tell any outsiders. 
Never spoil the trick; that's the first rule of magic. 
But they didn't completely operate in secret, because very early on they decided to hold a yearly stunt. 
At the end of the school year, they'd perform a magic trick for everyone in the building. 
And while Aleisha first viewed this idea with a healthy dose of "I am not sure if we can pull this off "-doubt, when that day came, she truly believed, no, *knew* that it was going to be something special.

The first year was the Year of Levitation. 
One of the Meerkats, Sarah, was levitated ten inches above the podium that oversaw the auditorium. 
Aaron, who else, presented the spectacle in a manner only he could get away with. 
He indeed used a cape. 
But besides Aaron's complete disregard for fashion, the show went alright. 
Sarah floated in place for a good five minutes while Aaron talked about something to do with 'chakras' and 'thinking lightly.'
They managed to borrow a smoke machine for that extra bit of drama. 
And Aaron even did that hoop-thing, to show that there were no wires involved.

The shows were something special. 
And Aleisha was glad to be part of it, even though she mostly worked in the background. 
Because the club meant way more to Aleisha and the Meerkats than just those yearly shows. 
They met weekly. 
The friendships they made were probably the most special thing to ever come out of the club. 

And then highschool ended. 
Not all at once, but it did end.

Aleisha, Sarah, and another boy called Dennis were the first members to finish school.
Aleisha took a gap year, Sarah went to a local community college and Dennis signed up for two hundred reality tv-programs and spent his time doing that.
Aleisha was also surprised when she heard about that.
It turns out to be a well-paying job once you get in.
It certainly paid better than whatever Aleisha was earning at the local bistro she worked at.

Aaron had to redo a year as calculus turned out to be too arcane even for him.
It did mean that he was able to present one extra show, the Year of Teleportation.
Yes, it was exactly as cool as it sounds, and Aleisha was there.
She had helped with a part of the setup and knew some of the behind the scenes, yet presentation is key with these things.
After the performance concluded, she was left with an overwhelming feeling of wonder, excitement, and disappointment.
Disappointment because it almost started to look like she had peaked in high school, which is objectively one of the saddest fates anyone can experience.

She talked to Aaron about this after the show, when the Magic Meerkats were left alone to clean-up.

"What are you doing after this?" she asked.  
"I've been looking for magician schools and there aren't that many," Aaron replied.  
"Have you tried Hogwarts?" Aleisha proposed.  
"No, but I did join a magician ring."  
"Oh yeah, you told me about that: the International Brotherhood of Magicians," she said, "It's an excellent name."  
"It sure is, but I don't think I can stay here. This is not exactly the place where I can get my big break." Aaron said, broadly gesturing at the auditorium which was demystified by the bright fluorescent tubes.  
"I suppose so. How far are you moving?"  
"I was thinking of Las Vegas, but that might be short-sighted," he said.  

Many people would call his career path short-sighted in its entirety, but Aleisha appreciated it's non-conventionalness. 
If it's stupid and it works, it isn't stupid.

"Chicago?"  
"Probably, I'm still figuring it out. What are you going to do this summer?"  
"I honestly got no clue. Maybe just work," she said, neglecting to tell Aaron about the promotion she recently received.  
It didn't feel very important.  

Aaron simply hummed in confirmation, which paused the conversation for a while.
They needed to help the others with disassembling the big teleportation box, which was ridiculously heavy for being mostly empty.
The cleaning was mostly uneventful after that.
Dan and Regio didn't seem to stop throwing cards, but when the janitors came to do a final checkup, everything was clutter-free.
They left the school and headed for a local pizzeria.
There was plenty to celebrate and Aaron wasn't done with Aleisha yet.

"Hey Aleisha, about that vacation of yours?" he began while eyeing the kitchen as they were waiting for their food.  
"The non-existent one?" she said.  
"Yes, that one. What's your opinion on road trips?"  
"You don't have a license," she noted, as she had an idea where this was going.  
"You do." he smiled.  
"Do you have a car you can borrow for a week?"  
"Believe it or not, I actually do. My dad's car is due for a replacement and I think I can borrow his old one before he sells it off," he said, "Should be fine as long as you don't total it."  

Aleisha thought for a moment, she liked the idea of adventure but wasn't sure if she'd like the actual thing.
Still, it felt like something she should do.
Like it was somehow expected, like it'd be worth something.

"It sounds uncomfortable and tiresome, but I think I want to do it," she said eventually.  
"Then let's do it," Aaron said.
