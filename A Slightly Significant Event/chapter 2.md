# The Sedan Airlift

It may have seemed like that was that, but in reality, there were a lot of preparations they had to do.
First things first, it wasn't just Aleisha and Aaron.
Sarah and Dan also accepted Aarons invitation.
Peter was also briefly considered, as he was one of the oldest Meerkat members, but he would be competing in Big Brother that summer and wouldn't be available.
Dan was a good friend of Aaron and also graduated high school that year.

But with the crew assembled there was still this small problem in the form of parental supervision.
There were, of course, the usual promises.
Promises to call, to look after each other, promises to be very careful.
No drunk driving, no drugs, no splitting up; you get the gist.
This placated most parents, but not all of them.
After this herculean effort, there were still two problems, Dan's parents and the car.

Two weeks before the trip Aleisha got a message from Aaron.

Aaron: *I need your help...*  
Aleisha: *What?*  
Aa: *My dad doesn't like the idea of me borrowing his old car for a week.*  

As it goes with planned trips, Aleisha had gotten invested.
She wanted to do it now. 
She had been looking forward to it ever since Aaron suggested it. 

Al: *Fuck, can we get another car?*  
Aa: *I've got another thing I want to try first. Can you come over?*  
Al: *Sure, what is it?*  

The explanation was repeated when Aaron intercepted her as she walked to his front door.

"So glad you could make it. This is going to work, I can feel it. My parents really like you, so you should be able to convince them," he said excitedly.   
"Slow down! Why don't your parents want to lend us the car in the first place?" Aleisha replied while standing in the grass of a nicely trimmed lawn.  
"It's mostly my dad. He needs the money from the old car to finance the new one.  He fears that if we wreck the old car, he can't afford the downpayment on his new car," Aaron explained.  
"That sounds like a very reasonable and adult thing to worry about," Aleisha said, "Have you considered getting some other car or truck or whatever?"  
"But we won't wreck his car, come on!" said Aaron.  
"I'll try, but mostly because I don't know any other options off the top of my head," she eventually concluded.  

They headed in.
Aaron lived in a standard suburban home.
Two parents, two kids, and a basketball hoop bolted to the top of the garage.
They weren't rich, not by any stretch of the imagination, but they did consider themselves wealthy.
There's a world of difference between those two concepts.

When Aleisha entered she noticed her objective almost immediately.
Aarons dad sat on a comfy chair in the corner of the living room, where he was reading the local newspaper.

"Good afternoon, mister Miller," she said after she sat down on the couch that almost swallowed her whole.

He put down his newspaper and straightened his back: "Right, do you two want anything to drink?"  
"No, we're not thirsty," Aaron said while sitting down on the armrest next to Aleisha, "We actually wanted to talk to you about something."   
"Is it the car again?" he asked, rolling his eyes.  
"We won't crash it!" Aaron said reflexively.  

Aleisha, who was a bit thirsty actually, decided that she should probably de-escalate: "If it makes you feel any better, mister Miller, I'll be the one driving."  
Aarons dad looked at Aleisha and then back at Aaron: "That makes me feel slightly better, but you have to do more to convince me."  
An idea came to Aleisha, something to tip the scale: "I could practice with your car, mister Miller, to show that I can drive safely."  

And he agreed. 
What followed was one of the most stressful car rides of Aleisha's life.
Aarons dad continually looked over her shoulder while she carefully handled his precious 10-year-old sedan.
Aaron also didn't help, since he seemed incapable of sitting still, but Aleisha managed.

After she removed the keys from contact, Miller gave them permission: "Fine. You two can have the car. Just one last thing."

Aleisha visibly loosened up after hearing that, would there be a catch?

"If you do end up crashing the car, you are going to pay for the damages, or, more likely, the downpayment of the new car. Good luck." he finished.

He left the car and went back to his newspaper. An awkward silence followed.

"We could've promised him that the whole time, couldn't we?" Aaron broke the silence.  
"I... I think we could've." Aleisha said as it slowly dawned on her that the last hour, which was more stressful than her driver's exam, was completely unnecessary.

And that's how the car-problem was solved.
Sadly, the Dan-problem was orders of magnitude harder.
His parents were insane.
And they weren't fond of the road trip.
They weren't fond of many things, not his friends, not his preferred study, not his tendency to do many extracurricular activities.
His mom was the Apache gunship of helicopter parents and his dad was arguably worse with his simultaneous hyperfocus on academic achievement and complete disregard for every other thing his son does.
They weren't anti-vax, that was perhaps something.

It was the Wednesday before the Saturday they would leave.
Aleisha managed to get off early from work and meet up with the other three Meerkats destined for the road trip.
So there they were, brought together in a small park late in the afternoon.
After the initial greetings, Aaron made a hand signal towards Dan, while silently mouthing a question.

Aleisha didn't have a clue what was going on, but Dan did and he quickly responded: "It's off, don't worry."  
"What was that about?" Sarah asked. 
She was wholly unaware of Dan's predicament as he didn't speak about his home life often or at all.  
"It's a recent development," Dan said, "My mom installed an app on my phone that keeps track of my location and can eavesdrop on things I say."  
"That's insane," Sarah said, voicing what Aleisha thought and Aaron already knew.  
"My phone is off, so we're safe," Dan said, "I 'forgot' to charge my phone last night so I have an excuse."  

Aleisha realized that Dan's problem was way bigger than expected.
She had assumed that it would simply take some sweet words and well-delivered promises to convince his parents.

"But yeah, my parents. They won't let me go," he continued.  
"I've been thinking this over for a while and I wasn't able to come up with a good solution here," Aaron said, "That's why I  wanted to meet up in the first place."

The picnic table they sat around suddenly turned into a war room.

"I'm not sure that this problem has a solution, Aaron. People aren't puzzle boxes," Sarah said.  
She turned to Dan: "Your mom seems intense."  
"We're not going to leave Dan behind, I've been trying to get him away from his parents for two years now," Aaron interjected, "If I were to give up and, like, bring my brother instead, we wouldn't be here."

Those were the stakes; it would be a rescue mission.
After a short hour, they decided on a plan.
Aleisha had provided the initial idea for the plan, while Sarah and Dan critiqued it mercilessly until it seemed feasible.
The only thing they hadn't decided on was the person responsible for the delivery, the execution.
Aaron would've done it in a heartbeat if it weren't for the fact that he was too well known in Dan's household.
Dan couldn't do it for obvious reasons, leaving only Sarah and Aleisha.
The method with which they made the final decision was highly scientific: Rock paper scissors and the winner got to choose.

Sarah came out on top with paper.
"Damn it, I hoped you'd win," she said, "I don't want to unload this onto you."
"Don't worry, I can take it," Aleisha said. The shadows were lengthening and Dan's mom could come to pick him up at any time.
"You're not helping," Sarah said.
She sighed: "Fine. I'll do it."

Aaron fist-bumped the air in celebration.
Dan smiled silently.
He didn't look so confident, but he was thoroughly enjoying the moment.

"Friday afternoon, 3 PM," Aaron said, "when Aaron has his piano lessons. If you need any help practicing, you can call me."

There was one last idea that afternoon. A small one, but it might've made the difference.

"Dress conservatively," Dan finally said, before walking over to his mom who was waiting in the car.
